This is the final project from Break Into Tech bootcamp. 
Here, I demostrate my knowledge of SQL using the database provided by the course. 

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country <> "USA";

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table 
should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.Invoiceid, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
    ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = "Sales Support Agent";

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.invoices;

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust 
    ON emp.Employeeid = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv 
    ON cust.Customerid = inv.Customerid;
    
7. Show the 
    Invoice Total, 
    Customer name, 
    Country, and 
    Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, emp.Title
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust
    ON inv.Customerid = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.employees emp 
    ON emp.Employeeid = cust.SupportRepId;
    

8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN "2009-01-01" AND "2009-12-31";
    
9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN "2009-01-01" AND "2009-12-31";

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
    ON i.Trackid = t.Trackid
    
11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name AS Track, ar.Name AS Artist, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN tracks t
    ON i.Trackid = t.Trackid
JOIN albums a
    ON a.Albumid = t.Albumid
LEFT JOIN artists ar
    ON a.Artistid = ar.Artistid

12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS Track, al.title as Album, m.name AS Media_type, g.name AS Genre
FROM albums al 
JOIN tracks t
    ON al.Albumid = t.Albumid
LEFT JOIN media_types m
    ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
LEFT JOIN genres g
    ON g.Genreid = t.Genreid

13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) AS [Total Sales]
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
    ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
    ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;


14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.Employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.Customers AS cust 
    ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices AS Inv 
    ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC
LIMIT 1;
