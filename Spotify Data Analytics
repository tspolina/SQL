For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, added data to SQLite Studio and explored the data using SQL. 

/* 1. What's the average danceability by artist and track? */

SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability) AS 'Average Danceability' 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

/* 2. Who are top 10 artists based on popularity? */

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

/* 3. What artist released the longest song? */

SELECT track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC;

/* 4. What is the average danceability for 10 most popular songs? */

SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;
